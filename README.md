# Running up that Hill - Analyzing Runkeeper Fitness data

In this Jupyter Notebook I explore my Runkeeper Fitness Data and analyze my Running and Cycling activities from 2012 till 2022. 

I clean, manipulate and visualize the data set to get some insights and find out that I need to get back to running.

Packages used: <br />
Pandas for data manipulation <br />
Matplotlib for plotting <br />
