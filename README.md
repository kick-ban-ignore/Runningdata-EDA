# Running up that Hill

## Analyzing Runkeeper Fitness data

------------
In this Jupyter Notebook I explore my Runkeeper Fitness Data and analyze my Running and Cycling activities from 2012 till 2022. 

I clean, manipulate and visualize the data set to get some insights and find out that I need to get back to running.

Packages used:
Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib for plotting
